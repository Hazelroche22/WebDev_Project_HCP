        Meet John O'Reilly, the mastermind behind Wheels on Fire, a car business that's all about passion for cars and a
        love for finely tuned engines. John has been in the car world for as long as he can remember, and it's clear
        that his heart beats for every engine, gear, and sleek curve of a car. His fascination with cars started as a
        young boy, watching his father work on classic cars in the garage. From there, John became captivated with the
        craft of auto repair, restoration, and the beauty of high-performance vehicles.
