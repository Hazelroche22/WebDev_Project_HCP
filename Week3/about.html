    <h3>About John O'Reilly - Owner of Wheels on Fire</h3>
<p>
Meet John O'Reilly, the mastermind behind Wheels on Fire, a car business that's all about passion for cars and a love for finely tuned engines. John has been in the car world for as long as he can remember, and it's clear that his heart beats for every engine, gear, and sleek curve of a car. His fascination with cars started as a young boy, watching his father work on classic cars in the garage. From there, John became captivated with the craft of auto repair, restoration, and the beauty of high-performance vehicles.
</p>
<h4>A Perfectionist at Heart</h4>
<p>
John’s attention to detail and relentless pursuit of perfection is evident in everything he does, whether it’s restoring vintage cars to their original glory or helping clients find the perfect ride. He often jokes that he gets along better with cars than with people—after all, cars don't talk back (unless, of course, you count the engine’s roar). He’s known for his dry humor, which he skillfully incorporates into his customer interactions.
</p>
<h4>Wheels on Fire: A Passion Project</h4>
<p>
His business, Wheels on Fire, is a reflection of his lifelong dedication to the automotive industry. John offers a wide range of services, from selling high-end performance vehicles to restoring classic cars that need a little TLC. His goal isn't just to sell cars; he wants to help people find the car that truly suits them. Whether you're a first-time buyer or a car enthusiast looking for that rare gem, John prides himself on providing a personalized service that goes beyond just finding you a set of wheels. His website, which he’s currently in the process of creating, will showcase his diverse collection of cars and offer advice with a healthy dose of his signature wit.
</p>
<h4>Outside the Garage</h4>
<p>
When he's not in the shop or working on his cars, John enjoys cruising down the coast in his vintage Mustang, attending car shows, and—strangely enough—watching documentaries about famous car designers. He’s also an amateur mechanic, often taking on side projects to further hone his craft. When not tinkering with engines, you might find John playing a round of golf or enjoying a quiet evening with a good book and his favorite jazz records.
</p>
<h4>A Personal Touch</h4>
<p>
What makes John stand out is his ability to merge passion with business. His genuine love for cars is contagious, and he takes great pride in ensuring that every customer has the perfect car experience. Whether it’s through his expert recommendations or a funny comment about car troubles, John makes every interaction feel personal and memorable.

<p>
In the world of cars, John O'Reilly is a name you can trust. His perfectionism, humor, and deep knowledge of the automotive industry make him a true asset to anyone looking to add a bit of fire to their wheels.</p>
